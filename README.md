In games that use the element of randomness to the gameplay, often times, regular faced dices are used. However, for the dice to produce an ideal distribution, the time taken is relatively longer than the
time period of game itself. One of the ways of mitigating this situation, is the use of card stack, where the card stack stores the card that corresponds to the combination generated by the dice roll, if in case
the dice was rolled.

The java based application presented in this documentation, is specifically, and designed to solve the issue with regular dice rolls. In addition to storing the combination in the form of a card, it also promotes
a fair randomness by optimizing the occurrence of each combination towards statistically favorable distribution.Moreover, it has many advantages over real life card stack adaptation. It can generate
virtually any kind of dices which means it is able to simulate the rolling of multi-dimensional dices that is not possible in real world. It can independently track multiple type of dice’s rolling’s& maintain graphs of
frequencies.

This report incorporates mainly 3 parts – the source code of the application, the testing carried out full
coverage of verification & validation of all classes, and finally the UML based class diagram to provide
the overview of the application’s design.
